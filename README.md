# About Kaizen

Kaizen - the Japanese term meaning "change for the better" or "continuous” improvement. When researching ways to cope with mental health issues, a solution that frequently came about was communicating one’s thoughts through a daily journal. We additionally found out that medical practitioners prescribe daily journals to patients suffering from mental disorders and illnesses as a way of learning about patients’ daily challenges and their moods. However, what we found was that medical practitioners had the responsibilities of getting a daily overview for all of their patient’s mental condition. Coupled with the fact that nearly 1 in 5 American adults will have a diagnosable mental health condition in any given year, medical practitioners will have to deal with numerous patients and read a lot of journals. Moreover as patients value privacy, more patients would feel less inclined to show some parts of their journal. Without compensating the privacy of our patients, our group wanted to give medical practitioners a score-based convenient and quicker way to pinpoint serious mental issues earlier and save lives in the form of Kaizen.
